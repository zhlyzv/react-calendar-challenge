# React/Redux Developer Task - React Calendar

The aim of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React & Redux.

You should start by rendering a single month view of a calendar for the current month - along the lines of the below illustration:
![Calendar design](react-calendar-dev-test.png)

Once this is rendered, please implement as many of the following requirements as time allows:
* Ability to add a new “reminder” (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time.
* Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
* Allow the user to select a colour when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
* Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
* Ability to edit reminders – including changing text, day and time & colour.
* Ability to delete reminders.
* Expand the calendar to support more than current month.
